This is a To-Do List Application built using Java Spring Boot on the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the frontend. It allows users to efficiently manage their tasks by adding categories, tracking progress with a progress bar, and staying motivated with a daily streak counter.

The application demonstrates the full-stack development process, showcasing backend API creation with Spring Boot and client-side interaction through JavaScript. The simple but interactive UI makes it easy to manage tasks, filter by category, and track productivity visually.

This project is designed to:

Explore RESTful API development with Spring Boot.
Apply frontend and backend integration.
Provide a practical example of using JavaScript for DOM manipulation and visual feedback.
With clear progress tracking and task filtering capabilities, the app is suitable for daily use and can be extended with more features like user authentication or cloud deployment.
